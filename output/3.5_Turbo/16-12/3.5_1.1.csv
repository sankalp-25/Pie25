- **Intent:** List stocks with low price volatility and consistent trading volume over the past month.

- **Required Tables:** `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`

- **Columns:**
    - From `master_prime_1d`: `security_code`, `company_name`
    - From `equity_prices_1d`: `security_code`, `high`, `low`, `volume`

- **Conditions:**
    - Price volatility can be calculated using the `high` and `low` prices over the past month.
    - Consistent trading volume can be determined by analyzing the `volume` over the past month.

- **Joins:** 
    - Join `master_prime_1d` and `equity_prices_1d` tables on the `security_code` column.

- **Aggregations:** 
    - Calculate the price volatility by finding the difference between `high` and `low` prices.
    - Analyze the trading volume to identify consistent trading behavior.

- **Sorting/Grouping:**
    - Possible sorting by price volatility (low to high) and trading volume (consistent to inconsistent).

**Note:** Please confirm the definition of ""low price volatility"" and ""consistent trading volume"" for more specific query construction.","```sql
