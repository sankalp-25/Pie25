Find stocks where the price dropped by more than 5% with unusually high volume.,"### Intent: Find stocks where the price dropped by more than 5% with unusually high volume.

- **Required Tables**: `equity_prices_1d`

Can you list stocks with low price volatility and consistent trading volume over the past month?,"- **Intent**: Retrieve stocks with low price volatility and consistent trading volume over the past month.
- **Required Tables**: `equity_prices_1d`
- **Columns**: `security_code`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`
- **Conditions**: 
  - Price volatility criteria can be calculated using the formula (high - low) / close. Therefore, to identify low price volatility, we can set a threshold for this ratio.
  - To ensure consistent trading volume, we can calculate the average trading volume over the past month and compare each day's volume with this average.
  - Date range condition for the past month.
