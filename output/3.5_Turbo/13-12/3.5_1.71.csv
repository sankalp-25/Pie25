Which stocks on NSE showed the highest price increase in the last trading session?,"- **Intent**: Find the stocks listed on  with the highest price increase in the last trading session.
- **Required Tables**: `master_prime_2d`, `equity_prices_2d`
- **Columns**: `short_company_name`, `close`, `date_time`
- **Conditions**: `index_name = 'Nifty 500'` ( is represented by Nifty 500 in the `master_prime_2d` table),  `date_time = <Last Trading Date>` (This will need to be dynamically determined)
- **Joins**: `master_prime_2d.security_code = equity_prices_2d.security_code`
- **Aggregations**: None (though we implicitly are finding the *max* price increase)
- **Sorting/Grouping**: Sort by `(close - Previous Day's Close)` in descending order, Limit 1 (or top N as required)


**Explanation of the Approach and Additional Notes:**

1. **Last Trading Date:**  The last trading date needs to be derived programmatically.  This could involve querying the `equity_prices_2d` table for the `max(date_time)`.
2. **Previous Day's Close:** Calculating the price increase requires the closing price from the previous trading day.  This can be achieved with a subquery or window function depending on the SQL dialect used.  The subquery would fetch the close price for the `date_time = <Last Trading Date - 1 day>`.
3. ** Representation:**  The provided schema doesn't have a direct """" column. I've used `index_name = 'Nifty 500'` as a proxy,  assuming this represents -listed stocks.  If there's a more accurate way to identify  stocks in your actual data, that should be used.
4. **Top N:** The question asks for the ""highest"" increase, implying just the top stock. However, it can be easily modified to fetch the top N stocks by adjusting the `LIMIT` clause.
5. **SQL Query Sketch (Illustrative - Adapt to your specific database):**

```sql
SELECT mp.short_company_name
FROM master_prime_2d mp
JOIN equity_prices_2d ep ON mp.security_code = ep.security_code
WHERE mp.index_name = 'Nifty 500'
  AND ep.date_time = <Last Trading Date>  -- Replace with dynamic query to get last trading date
ORDER BY (ep.close - (SELECT close FROM equity_prices_2d WHERE security_code = ep.security_code AND date_time = <Last Trading Date - 1 day>)) DESC  -- Replace with dynamic date calculation
LIMIT 1;
```


This preprocessed output provides the essential building blocks to construct a SQL query to answer the original natural language question.  It emphasizes extracting the key components in a structured way for easier query generation. Remember to replace placeholders like `<Last Trading Date>` and `<Last Trading Date - 1 day>` with appropriate dynamic date calculations in your final SQL.

Which stocks had the highest volume traded/volume buzzer compared to yesterday on NSE?,"- **Intent**: Retrieve the stocks traded on  with the highest volume compared to the previous day.
- **Required Tables**: `equity_prices_2d`
- **Columns**: `security_code`, `volume`, `date_time`
- **Conditions**: `date_time = CURRENT_DATE` (for today's volume) and `date_time = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'` (for yesterday's volume).  We'll also likely need to filter by exchange () if that information is available, but it isn't in the provided schema.  *If* there's a separate table with exchange information, a join would be needed.
- **Joins**:  None based on the provided table schemas (see conditions note above).
- **Aggregations**: None explicitly, but we'll implicitly be finding the maximum volume difference.
- **Sorting/Grouping**: Sort by the difference in volume (today - yesterday) in descending order to get the ""highest.""  We can potentially add a `LIMIT` clause to get the top N stocks.




**Explanation and Further Considerations:**

1. ** Filter:** The question specifies ""on .""  The provided database schema doesn't include exchange information.  A practical implementation would require either:
   - An additional table linking `security_code` to exchange.  This would necessitate a `JOIN`.
   - A column in `equity_prices_2d` indicating the exchange.

2. **Calculating Volume Difference:** The SQL query will need to calculate the difference between today's volume and yesterday's volume for each stock.  This might involve subqueries or window functions.

3. **""Volume Buzzer"":** The term ""volume buzzer"" likely refers to unusual or significantly higher volume compared to the previous day or some other baseline.  A more sophisticated solution could involve comparing volume to a moving average or setting a threshold for what constitutes a ""buzzer.""

4. **Handling Missing Data:** The query should consider cases where a stock didn't trade on either yesterday or today.  We might need to use `COALESCE` or other techniques to handle nulls gracefully.



**Example SQL Snippet (Illustrative - assumes  data is available):**

This is a simplified snippet; the exact implementation will depend on the database system and how  data is stored.

Find stocks where the price dropped by more than 5% with unusually high volume.,"- **Intent**: Find stocks with a price drop of more than 5% and unusually high volume.

- **Required Tables**: `equity_prices_2d`

- **Columns**: `date_time`, `security_code`, `close`, `volume`

- **Conditions**: 
    - Calculate the percentage change in price:  `(close - close_previous_day) / close_previous_day * 100 < -5`  (where `close_previous_day` needs a subquery or window function to obtain).
    - ""Unusually high volume"" needs further definition.  A possible approach is to compare the current day's volume to the average volume over a recent period (e.g., last 30 days) for the same stock: `volume > 1.5 * avg_volume_30_days` (where `avg_volume_30_days` requires a subquery or window function).  The 1.5 factor is an example and can be adjusted.

- **Joins**: None explicitly stated, but self-join or window function required for previous day's closing price and average volume calculations.

- **Aggregations**: `AVG(volume)` (over the last 30 days for each stock Ã¢ÂÂ to be used in the volume condition)


- **Sorting/Grouping**: Possibly group by `security_code` to get results per stock.


**Further Refinements and Considerations:**

* **Defining ""Unusually High Volume""**: This requires a precise definition. Options include:
    - Comparing to a fixed threshold.
    - Comparing to a moving average.
    - Comparing to the historical distribution of volumes for the specific stock (e.g., using percentiles).
* **Time Window for Comparison**: The query doesn't specify a time window for the price drop or volume comparison.  This needs clarification.
* **SQL Implementation**: The exact SQL query will depend on the specific database system used. Window functions (e.g., `LAG`, `AVG` with `OVER` clause) or self-joins can be used to calculate the previous day's closing price and the average volume.


Example SQL Query Snippet (PostgreSQL syntax - illustrating some of the concepts):

```sql
SELECT
    ep.date_time,
    ep.security_code,
    ep.close,
    ep.volume
FROM
    equity_prices_2d ep
WHERE
    (ep.close - LAG(ep.close, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ep.security_code ORDER BY ep.date_time)) / LAG(ep.close, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ep.security_code ORDER BY ep.date_time) * 100 < -5

        AVG(ep.volume) OVER (PARTITION BY ep.security_code ORDER BY ep.date_time ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)

```

This snippet demonstrates calculating the percentage change and comparing the volume to a 30-day moving average.  Adaptations would be needed for different database systems and specific requirements for ""unusually high volume.""
