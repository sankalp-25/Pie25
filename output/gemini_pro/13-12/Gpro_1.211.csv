"Give me the 5 best-performing stocks of Nifty500 from 15th September 2023 to 26th October 2023 and filter out 2 among 5 which have the least performance in the next 10 days. Also, show the next 10-day performance.",,success,"- Intent: Find the 5 best-performing Nifty 500 stocks between 2023-09-15 and 2023-10-26, then filter out the 2 with the lowest performance over the next 10 days (2023-10-27 to 2023-11-05).

- Required Tables: `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`

- Columns: `company_name`, `date_time`, `close`, `index_name`

- Conditions:
    - `index_name LIKE '%Nifty 500%'`
    - `date_time BETWEEN '2023-09-15' AND '2023-10-26'` (Period 1)
    - `date_time BETWEEN '2023-10-27' AND '2023-11-05'` (Period 2)


- Joins: `master_prime_1d.security_code = equity_prices_1d.security_code`

- Aggregations: None (Performance will be calculated using closing prices)

- Sorting/Grouping:
    - Sort by performance in Period 1 (descending) to get the top 5.
    - Sort by performance in Period 2 (ascending) to remove the bottom 2.



Following are steps to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Performance (Period 1):**  Determine the price change percentage for each stock between 2023-09-15 and 2023-10-26.

2. **Get Top 5:** Select the top 5 stocks based on the performance calculated in step 1.

3. **Calculate Performance (Period 2):** For the selected 5 stocks, calculate the performance over the next 10 days (2023-10-27 to 2023-11-05).

4. **Filter Bottom 2:** Remove the 2 stocks with the lowest performance from step 3.

5. **Output:** Display the final 3 stocks and their performance in both periods. 

Note : The exact SQL query will involve subqueries or common table expressions (CTEs) to handle the staged calculations and sorting required by this complex query.  It also requires calculating percentage changes between start and end dates of the specified periods for each stock which requires careful handling of edge cases (like zero starting prices).

Here's a breakdown of how to approach this complex query with SQL and how the preprocessing helps:

1. **Weekly Volume Increase Calculation:**

This part is the most challenging. We need to calculate weekly volumes and then check for a two-week cocutive increase.  This will involve subqueries and date manipulation within SQL.  A simplified example of the core logic (the actual implementation would be more elaborate to handle edge cases and specific date requirements):

```sql
WITH WeeklyVolumes AS (
    SELECT
        security_code,
        DATE_TRUNC('week', date_time) AS week_start,  -- Group by week
        SUM(volume) AS weekly_volume
    FROM
        equity_prices_1d
    WHERE date_time <= '2024-07-16'
    GROUP BY
        security_code, week_start
),
LaggedVolumes AS (
    SELECT
        security_code,
        week_start,
        weekly_volume,
        LAG(weekly_volume, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY security_code ORDER BY week_start) AS previous_week_volume,
        LAG(weekly_volume, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY security_code ORDER BY week_start) AS two_weeks_ago_volume
    FROM
        WeeklyVolumes
)
SELECT
    security_code
FROM
    LaggedVolumes
WHERE
    weekly_volume > previous_week_volume AND previous_week_volume > two_weeks_ago_volume;

```

2. **10-Day and 20-Day Performance:**
   This requires calculating percentage changes in closing prices. We'll likely need another subquery or common table expression (CTE) to achieve this efficiently. Again, here is simplified SQL illustrating how this can be combined:
   ```sql

WITH WeeklyVolumes AS (
    -- Same as before--
),
LaggedVolumes AS (
    -- Same as before --
),
QualifyingStocks AS(
SELECT
    security_code
FROM
    LaggedVolumes
WHERE
    weekly_volume > previous_week_volume AND previous_week_volume > two_weeks_ago_volume
),
Prices AS (
  SELECT
        ep.security_code,
        ep.date_time,
        ep.close
    FROM
        equity_prices_1d ep
        JOIN QualifyingStocks qs ON ep.security_code = qs.security_code
    WHERE ep.date_time <= '2024-07-16'
)
SELECT
    p.security_code,
    p.date_time,
    (p.close - LAG(p.close, 10) OVER (PARTITION BY p.security_code ORDER BY p.date_time)) * 100.0 / LAG(p.close, 10) OVER (PARTITION BY p.security_code ORDER BY p.date_time) as ten_day_performance,
    (p.close - LAG(p.close, 20) OVER (PARTITION BY p.security_code ORDER BY p.date_time)) * 100.0 / LAG(p.close, 20) OVER (PARTITION BY p.security_code ORDER BY p.date_time)  as twenty_day_performance
FROM Prices p;

```

The structured preprocessing provides the key elements that are then used to build these more complex SQL queries.  It breaks down the user's request into the fundamental parts the database needs to execute it.","```sql

  SELECT
    ""security_code"",
    DATE_TRUNC('week', ""date_time"") AS ""week_start"",

","- Intent: Retrieve the 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 6-month performance of all Nifty 50 stocks that have shown positive gains for three cocutive weeks.

- Required Tables: `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`

- Columns: `date_time`, `close`, `index_name`, `company_name`

- Conditions: 
    - `index_name LIKE '%Nifty 50%'`
    - Three cocutive weeks of positive gains (This requires a complex subquery or CTE to determine)

- Joins: `master_prime_1d.security_code = equity_prices_1d.security_code`

- Aggregations: None (Performance calculation will involve comparing closing prices, not aggregation)

- Sorting/Grouping: None


Here's how the complex condition for ""three cocutive weeks of positive gains"" can be translated into a SQL fragment (using a CTE for clarity):

```sql
WITH WeeklyClosingPrices AS (
    SELECT
        mp.company_name,
        ep.date_time,
        ep.close,
        DATE_TRUNC('week', ep.date_time) AS week_start
    FROM
        equity_prices_1d ep
    JOIN
        master_prime_1d mp ON ep.security_code = mp.security_code
    WHERE mp.index_name LIKE '%Nifty 50%' 
),
LaggedWeeklyReturns AS (
  SELECT
        company_name,
        week_start,
        close,
        LAG(close, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY company_name ORDER BY week_start) AS prev_close,  -- Previous week's closing price
        LAG(close, 2, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY company_name ORDER BY week_start) AS prev_prev_close -- Closing price two weeks ago
    FROM WeeklyClosingPrices
),
ThreeWeekGains AS (
    SELECT
        company_name
    FROM LaggedWeeklyReturns
    WHERE (close > prev_close) AND (prev_close > prev_prev_close)
    GROUP BY company_name  -- To avoid duplicates if a company has multiple 3-week gain streaks
)
-- Now you can use the ThreeWeekGains CTE to filter the main query
SELECT ... -- The rest of your query to calculate performance
FROM ...
WHERE company_name IN (SELECT company_name FROM ThreeWeekGains)


-- Calculate 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 6-month performance
-- (Illustrative - the exact date calculations need to be adjusted based on your business logic)
SELECT 
  ep.date_time,
  mp.company_name,
  -- ... (Other calculations for 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, 6-month performance)
FROM equity_prices_1d ep
JOIN master_prime_1d mp ON ep.security_code = mp.security_code
WHERE mp.company_name IN (SELECT company_name FROM ThreeWeekGains); -- Filter by companies with 3 cocutive weeks of gain


```




This outlines the SQL structure necessary to handle the complex three-week gain condition, which involves lagged comparisons and grouping.  Remember to adapt the date calculations and performance calculations based on your specific requirements.","```sql

","- Intent: Find stocks that closed below their previous week's low on 16th September 2024.
- Required Tables: `equity_prices_1d`
- Columns: `date_time`, `security_code`, `close`, `low`
- Conditions: `date_time = '2024-09-16'`
- Joins: None
- Aggregations: `min(low)`
- Sorting/Grouping: None

Here's a more detailed breakdown for SQL query generation:

1. **Previous Week's Low Calculation**:
   - Need to determine the date range for the previous week (2024-09-09 to 2024-09-15).
   - Calculate the minimum `low` value for each `security_code` within this date range. This represents the previous week's low.

2. **Current Day's Close**:
   - Filter for records where `date_time = '2024-09-16'`.
   - Retrieve the `close` value for each `security_code` on this date.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the `close` value on 2024-09-16 with the calculated previous week's low for each `security_code`.
   - Select only those `security_code`s where the `close` is less than the previous week's low.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Retrieve the `company_name` corresponding to the selected `security_code`s from the `master_prime_1d` table.


This structured information allows for the generation of a SQL query to answer the given natural language query accurately.  It requires a subquery or common table expression (CTE) to effectively calculate the previous week's low and then compare it to the closing price on the specified date.

","- Intent: Find the top 10 worst-performing basic industry sectors in the previous month (2024-10-20 to 2024-11-19).

- Required Tables: `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`

- Columns: `master_prime_1d.major_sector_name`, `equity_prices_1d.close`, `equity_prices_1d.date_time`

- Conditions:  `master_prime_1d.major_sector_name` IS NOT NULL , `equity_prices_1d.date_time` BETWEEN '2024-10-20' AND '2024-11-19'

- Joins: `master_prime_1d.security_code = equity_prices_1d.security_code`

- Aggregations: None (Calculating performance will involve comparing closing prices across the date range, but the initial aggregation only needs closing prices per sector per day.)

- Sorting/Grouping: Group by `master_prime_1d.major_sector_name`, then sort by performance (which will be calculated based on the closing prices for each sector over the date range) in ascending order (worst performers first) and Limit to 10.


Calculating sector performance will likely require a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) to first obtain the first and last closing prices within the date range for each sector, and then calculate the percentage change between them. The outer query would then select the top 10 worst performers based on this calculated percentage change.
