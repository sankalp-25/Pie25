Can you list stocks with low price volatility and consistent trading volume over the past month?,"- Intent: Find stocks with low price volatility and consistent trading volume over the past month.
- Required Tables: `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`
- Columns: `company_name`, `high`, `low`, `volume`, `date_time`
- Conditions: `date_time BETWEEN '2024-10-20' AND '2024-11-19'`
- Joins: `master_prime_1d.security_code = equity_prices_1d.security_code`
- Aggregations: None (Volatility will be calculated, not aggregated)
- Sorting/Grouping:  Potentially sorting by calculated volatility (ascending).


Note: ""Consistent trading volume"" is subjective and would typically require further clarification from the user to define what ""consistent"" means in this context (e.g., within a certain percentage range, a specific minimum volume, etc.).  The SQL query to calculate volatility and filter/sort would be constructed after this clarification.  The above output provides the necessary elements for that subsequent query construction.

- Sorting/Grouping: Sort by percentage change in closing price (descending for best, ascending for worst). Limit to top 5 for both.


Note: The ""return"" calculation (percentage change in closing price over the 10-day period) will need to be performed after the data is retrieved using a suitable method (e.g., calculating the percentage change between the closing price on the first and last day of the period for each stock).  The query will fetch the necessary closing prices for that calculation.  Then the top/bottom 5 can be identified based on these calculated returns.

"When was the last time the Nifty50 index went up for 3 weeks consecutively, and what was the performance in the next 3 months?","- Intent: Find the last date when Nifty50 had 3 cocutive weeks of positive returns and the performance of Nifty50 in the 3 months following that date.

- Required Tables: `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`

- Columns: `date_time`, `close`, `index_name`

- Conditions: `index_name LIKE '%Nifty 50%'`

- Joins: `master_prime_1d.security_code = equity_prices_1d.security_code`

- Aggregations: None (Calculating weekly and monthly returns requires multiple subqueries and comparisons, not simple aggregations).

- Sorting/Grouping: Order by `date_time` descending to find the last occurrence.


This query requires a complex SQL structure that can't be represented directly in simple aggregations or conditions. It involves:

1. **Calculating Weekly Returns:**  Grouping data by week and calculating the percentage change in `close` from the beginning to the end of each week.

2. **Identifying Cocutive Positive Weeks:** Finding sequences of 3 or more cocutive weeks where the weekly return is positive.

3. **Finding the Last Occurrence:** Determining the last date within the identified cocutive positive weeks.

4. **Calculating Subsequent 3-Month Performance:** Calculating the percentage change in `close` from the last identified date to 3 months later.


This kind of analysis typically requires a combination of SQL window functions (like `LAG` or `LEAD`), common table expressions (CTEs), and potentially stored procedures or user-defined functions for more complex logic.  The output will not be a simple aggregated value but a date (the last day of the 3-week uptrend) and a percentage change (the 3-month performance).

"Give me 10-day, 20-day performance whenever weekly volumes have increased for two consecutive weeks as of 16th July 2024.","- Intent: Retrieve the 10-day and 20-day performance of stocks where weekly volumes have increased for two cocutive weeks as of July 16, 2024.

- Required Tables: `equity_prices_1d`

- Columns: `date_time`, `security_code`, `close`, `volume`

- Conditions:  Weekly volume increase for two cocutive weeks leading up to 2024-07-16. This will involve calculating weekly volumes and comparing them. 

- Joins: None (self-join might be needed for volume comparisons across weeks)

- Aggregations: None (unless ""performance"" implies some aggregation like percentage change)

- Sorting/Grouping: None explicitly stated, but grouping might be needed for weekly volume calculations.


**Note:** This query requires more complex logic to handle the ""two cocutive weeks of volume increase"" condition.  A standard SQL query alone is not sufficient. We need procedural logic or window functions to achieve this.  A sample approach (using window functions which might not be supported in all SQL dialects) is sketched below, but would need to be adapted based on the specific database capabilities.

```sql -- Conceptual Approach (needs refinement)
WITH WeeklyVolumes AS (
    SELECT
        security_code,
        DATE_TRUNC('week', date_time) AS week_start,  -- Start of the week
        SUM(volume) AS weekly_volume
    FROM equity_prices_1d
    WHERE date_time <= '2024-07-16'
    GROUP BY security_code, week_start
),
LaggedVolumes AS (
    SELECT
        security_code,
        week_start,
        weekly_volume,
        LAG(weekly_volume, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY security_code ORDER BY week_start) as previous_week_volume,
        LAG(weekly_volume, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY security_code ORDER BY week_start) as two_weeks_ago_volume
    FROM WeeklyVolumes
)
SELECT
    ep.security_code,
    -- ... calculations for 10-day and 20-day performance ...
FROM equity_prices_1d ep
JOIN LaggedVolumes lv ON ep.security_code = lv.security_code
WHERE 
  lv.week_start <= '2024-07-16'
  AND lv.weekly_volume > lv.previous_week_volume  -- Current week > Previous week
  AND lv.previous_week_volume > lv.two_weeks_ago_volume -- Previous week > 2 weeks ago
-- ... add conditions to determine the 10-day and 20-day performance
;


```


This demonstrates the complexity. To make this executable, the ""... calculations for 10-day and 20-day performance..."" part needs to be fleshed out, and the exact SQL syntax might need to be adjusted for the specific database being used.

Key Changes and Explanations for ClickHouse:

1. **Double Quotes:** All table and column names are enclosed in double quotes.
2. **`toStartOfWeek`:** ClickHouse's function to get the beginning of the week.
3. **`lagInFrame`:** ClickHouse's window function equivalent for `LAG`.  This is crucial for comparing values across different rows (weeks in this case).
4. **Date Adjustments:** The dates in the 10-day and 20-day performance calculations need careful adjustment. The provided query uses placeholder dates; you'll need to calculate the correct dates based on the reference point ('2024-07-16').
5. **`IN` operator:** To efficiently filter stocks that meet the volume increase criteria.
6. **Division by Zero Protection:** Using `CASE WHEN` inside the `SUM` for performance calculations to avoid potential division by zero errors.
7. **Explicit Joins:** Using explicit `JOIN` syntax for combining the performance data.

This revised query is much closer to executable ClickHouse SQL and addresses the specific requirements of the problem while adhering to ClickHouse's syntax and best practices.  You will still need to verify and adjust the date logic and ensure that the data in your `equity_prices_1d` table covers the necessary date range.","

"Give me the 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 6-month performance of all Nifty50 stocks whenever it has given 3 consecutive weeks of positive gains.","- Intent: Retrieve the 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 6-month performance of Nifty50 stocks after three cocutive weeks of positive gains.
- Required Tables: `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`
- Columns: `date_time`, `close`, `index_name`
- Conditions: `index_name LIKE '%Nifty50%'` , Three cocutive weeks of positive gains.
- Joins: `master_prime_1d.security_code = equity_prices_1d.security_code`
- Aggregations: None
- Sorting/Grouping: None


This query requires a complex subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) to identify the periods of three cocutive weeks of positive gains.  The performance calculations (10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 6-month) would then be based on the closing prices relative to the start date of those 3-week periods.

A simplified SQL structure (using a CTE) is presented below.  A fully robust SQL query for this complex scenario may require further refinement depending on the exact definition of ""positive gains"" (e.g., based on closing prices, percentage change) and how to handle overlapping 3-week periods.


```sql
WITH ThreeWeekGains AS (
    -- Complex logic to identify 3 cocutive weeks of gains would go here.  
    -- This is a placeholder and needs to be fleshed out based on the exact requirements.
    -- The CTE should output the security_code and the start_date of the 3-week gain period.
    SELECT
        security_code,
        date_time as start_date  -- Start date of the 3-week period
    FROM
        equity_prices_1d
    WHERE ...  -- Conditions to identify 3-week gains 
)

SELECT
    mp.company_name,  -- DISTINCT company names
    ep.date_time,
    ep.close,
    -- Calculations for 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 6-month performance based on twg.start_date
    (
        SELECT close FROM equity_prices_1d 
        WHERE security_code = ep.security_code AND date_time = DATE(twg.start_date, '+10 days')
    ) as close_10d,
    (
        SELECT close FROM equity_prices_1d

    ) as close_30d,
    (
        SELECT close FROM equity_prices_1d

JOIN 
    ThreeWeekGains twg ON ep.security_code = twg.security_code
WHERE mp.index_name LIKE '%Nifty50%';

```



This structure provides a starting point.  The most crucial part to implement is the logic within the `ThreeWeekGains` CTE to correctly identify those 3-week periods.  The provided subqueries are placeholders, and further considerations for percentage calculation versus absolute price difference may be needed, as well as error handling (`CASE` statements or similar) for cases where there is no `close` price available for a calculated date.","```sql

"Give me the 5 best-performing stocks of Nifty500 from 15th September 2023 to 26th October 2023 and filter out 2 among 5 which have the least performance in the next 10 days. Also, show the next 10-day performance.","- Intent: Find the top 5 best-performing Nifty 500 stocks between 15-09-2023 and 26-10-2023, then identify the 2 worst performers among them over the subsequent 10 days (27-10-2023 to 05-11-2023), showing their performance in both periods.

- Required Tables: `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`

- Columns: `company_name`, `close`, `date_time`, `index_name`

- Conditions: 
    - `index_name LIKE '%Nifty 500%'`
    - Period 1: `date_time BETWEEN '2023-09-15' AND '2023-10-26'`
    - Period 2: `date_time BETWEEN '2023-10-27' AND '2023-11-05'`

- Joins: `master_prime_1d.security_code = equity_prices_1d.security_code`

- Aggregations: None (Implicitly, we'll calculate percentage change for performance)

- Sorting/Grouping:
    - Order by performance (percentage change in close price) in Period 1 (descending).
    - Then, among the top 5, order by performance in Period 2 (ascending) and limit to 2.


**Note:** The implementation will likely involve subqueries or CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to calculate and compare performance across the two periods efficiently. The output should show the `company_name` and their percentage change in `close` price for both periods.

Give me the top 10 best and worst performers of all Nifty500 stocks from 9th September 2024 to 27th September 2024.,"- Intent: Retrieve the top 10 best and worst performing Nifty 500 stocks between 2024-09-09 and 2024-09-27.
- Required Tables: `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`
- Columns: `company_name`, `close`, `date_time`, `index_name`
- Conditions:  `index_name LIKE '%Nifty 500%'`, `date_time BETWEEN '2024-09-09' AND '2024-09-27'`
- Joins: `master_prime_1d.security_code = equity_prices_1d.security_code`
- Aggregations: None
- Sorting/Grouping: Order by percentage change in closing price (calculated as (closing price on 2024-09-27 - closing price on 2024-09-09) / closing price on 2024-09-09),  LIMIT 10 for both best and worst performers.


**Further Notes (Not part of the structured output but for SQL generation):**

To achieve the desired output, the SQL query will need to calculate the price change percentage for each stock. This can be done by using subqueries or common table expressions (CTEs) to find the closing prices on the start and end dates. Then, the main query can join with the CTEs, calculate the percentage change, and order the results accordingly. A UNION ALL operation can be used to combine the top 10 best and worst performers.
