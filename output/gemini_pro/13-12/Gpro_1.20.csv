"On 16th September 2024, which stocks have closed below their previous week's low?","- Intent: Identify stocks that closed below their previous week's low on September 16, 2024.
- Required Tables: `equity_prices_1d`
- Columns: `date_time`, `security_code`, `close`, `low`
- Conditions: `date_time = '2024-09-16'` (for the current week's closing price), `date_time BETWEEN '2024-09-09' AND '2024-09-15'` (for the previous week's data)
- Joins: Self-join on `security_code` to compare current week's close with the previous week's low.
- Aggregations: `MIN(low)` (to find the previous week's low)
- Sorting/Grouping: None


More detailed breakdown for clarity:

1. **Current Week's Data:** We need the closing price (`close`) for each stock on '2024-09-16'.
2. **Previous Week's Data:** We need the lowest price (`low`) for each stock during the period '2024-09-09' to '2024-09-15'.
3. **Comparison:** We need to compare the `close` value from step 1 with the `MIN(low)` from step 2 for each `security_code`.
4. **Filtering:** We only want the `security_code` (and corresponding `company_name` from `master_prime_1d`) where the current week's `close` is less than the previous week's `MIN(low)`.


This requires a self-join on the `equity_prices_1d` table and a subsequent join with `master_prime_1d` to retrieve the company name.

Can you identify stocks trading below ?50 with high trading volumes?,"- Intent: Identify stocks trading below ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¹50 with high trading volumes.
- Required Tables: `equity_prices_1d`, `master_prime_1d`
- Columns: `close`, `volume`, `company_name`
- Conditions: `close < 50`,  `date_time` between '2024-10-20' and '2024-11-19' (last 20 days for volume calculation - this can be made more sophisticated if access to current date is available within the SQL environment).
- Joins: `equity_prices_1d.security_code = master_prime_1d.security_code`

- Sorting/Grouping: Potentially sort by volume in descending order to prioritize the highest volume stocks among those trading below ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¹50.

**Further Considerations:**

* **""High Volume"" Definition:** The query needs clarification on how to define ""high trading volume.""  Possible options include:
    * **Comparison to Average:** Calculate the average volume over the last 20 days and consider ""high volume"" as some multiple (e.g., 1.5x or 2x) of the average.  
    * **Percentile:**  Define ""high volume"" as belonging to the top n-th percentile of trading volumes within the chosen timeframe.
    * **Absolute Threshold:**  Use a fixed volume threshold (e.g., > 1,000,000 shares traded) to filter for high-volume stocks.
* **Timeframe:** The query defaults to a daily timeframe.  Is this correct, or should volume be calculated intraday?  
* **Sorting/Presentation:**  The output format isn't specified. Should the query return the `company_name`, `close` price, and the `volume`? 


If we assume ""high volume"" means greater than the average volume over the last 20 days, a sample structured query fragment (not complete SQL) would look like this:

Here's a breakdown of why some parts are designed this way:

* **Conditions**: The date condition dynamically calculates the ""last 10 days"" relative to the current date (2024-11-19).
* **Aggregations**:  While we need to calculate returns, this isn't a standard SQL aggregation like `SUM` or `AVG`. The return calculation will be a part of the SQL query itself, usually involving subqueries or window functions to compare closing prices on different dates.
* **Sorting/Grouping**: The query explicitly asks for ""top 5"" and ""bottom 5,"" implying sorting based on the calculated return.  This sorting will also be implemented within the SQL query using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the conditions and aggregations:

* **52-Week High Calculation**: This requires a subquery or window function within the SQL query to determine the maximum 'high' value for each stock over the past 52 weeks (2023-11-20 to 2024-11-19).

* **Price Range Condition**:  The `close` price should be between 90% and 95% of the calculated 52-week high.

* **10-Day Average Volume**: Another subquery or window function will calculate the average `volume` for each stock over the last 10 days (2024-11-09 to 2024-11-19).

Here's a more detailed breakdown for clarity and SQL generation:

2. **5% Threshold:**  We'll calculate the 5% threshold above the 3-month low.  The condition would be `close >= 0.95 * three_month_low`.

3. **Final Filtering:** Combine the conditions to filter for stocks meeting the criteria on 2024-09-20.

Calculating 3 cocutive weeks of positive gains requires complex SQL queries involving window functions and self-joins, making a single SQL query in this format challenging. It would be best to implement the ""3 cocutive weeks of positive gains"" logic in a separate preprocessing step before feeding the data into an SQL query.  This could be done using a programming language like Python with libraries like Pandas.  Once the qualifying stocks and dates are identified, a simpler SQL query can be used to retrieve the desired performance data.


HereÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs a conceptual outline of how the overall process would work:

1. **Preprocessing (Python with Pandas):**
    * Fetch data for Nifty50 stocks from the database.
    * Calculate weekly gains (e.g., using `resample` and `pct_change`).
    * Identify periods with 3 cocutive positive weekly gains (e.g., using a rolling window and a condition check).
    * Store the qualifying `security_code` and corresponding `date_time` (start of the 3-week period).

2. **SQL Query:**
    * Use the output from the preprocessing step to filter the `equity_prices_1d` table.  
    * Calculate 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 6-month performance using window functions and date comparisons relative to the preprocessed `date_time` values.
    * Output the results.


Due to the complexity of the date-based filtering, providing a complete, functional SQL query within this structure is not feasible. However, the above breakdown accurately outlines the data requirements, tables, columns, joins, and intent, separated from the complex conditional logic that's better handled outside a direct SQL query.

Key improvements and adherence to the instructions:

* **Preprocessing:** The complex logic of ""3 consecutive weeks of positive gains"" is assumed to be handled in a preprocessing step. This makes the SQL query manageable and efficient.
* **Temporary Table:**  The preprocessed data is assumed to be stored in a temporary table called `""positive_gain_periods""`, which this query joins against. This allows the query to leverage pre-calculated results.
* **Date Calculations:** The date ranges for 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 6-month performance calculations are dynamically calculated using `date_add` function relative to the `start_date` from the `positive_gain_periods` table.
* **Percentage Change:** The query calculates the percentage change relative to the closing price at the beginning of the period.
* **Handling Zero Division:** Using `CASE WHEN` to explicitly handle potential zero values in the `close` column prevents division by zero errors.
* **`LIKE` Operator:** The `LIKE` operator is used correctly with the string column `""index_name""`.
* **Double Quotes:** All table and column names are enclosed in double quotes.
* **Explicit Joins:**  All joins are explicit using `INNER JOIN` or `LEFT JOIN`.
* **Company Name:** Included `""company_name""` in the `SELECT` statement, using `DISTINCT` if necessary (depending on how the pre-processing is done).



This improved query addresses the complexities of the prompt while adhering to ClickHouse syntax and best practices. Remember to create the temporary table `positive_gain_periods` with the pre-processed data before running this query.  The Python code to generate this data is separate but crucial for this query to function.

While the provided SQL was mostly correct in terms of syntax and quoting, correlated subqueries are generally less efficient in ClickHouse than joins.  The optimized version leverages joins and pre-aggregates data where possible to improve performance.  This version also removes the redundant qualification of table aliases which ClickHouse's SQL parser handles automatically.  Here's a breakdown of the optimizations in the provided query and why they might not be suitable for ClickHouse:

* **Correlated Subqueries:**  The original query uses correlated subqueries to fetch the June 4th low and the 5-day average volume.  These repeatedly execute the inner query for each row in the outer query, leading to performance overhead.  The optimized query uses joins whenever possible.

* **Redundant Alias Qualification:** ClickHouse automatically resolves column references within a table's scope. The redundant qualification (like `T1.major_sector_name` where it's already clear that `major_sector_name` belongs to `T1`) has been removed.


It's crucial to test and benchmark different query versions in your specific ClickHouse environment to confirm performance improvements.  The provided optimized query aims to be a starting point for maximizing performance.

This query requires complex sequential calculations and cannot be directly expressed in a single SQL query. It would need to be implemented using a procedural approach or a more advanced analytical function within SQL, or potentially pre-calculated and stored as a separate dataset. The basic steps would be:

1. **Identify weeks:** Group data by week and calculate the weekly closing price (e.g., the last closing price of each week).
2. **Calculate weekly changes:** Determine the percentage change between cocutive weekly closing prices.
3. **Identify cocutive positive weeks:** Find sequences of three cocutive weeks where the percentage change is positive.
4. **Find the last occurrence:** Select the most recent date from the identified sequences.
5. **Calculate 3-month performance:** Calculate the percentage change in the closing price from the identified date to the closing price three months later.

Because of the nature of the question, the usual SQL query cannot be generated with the currently available SQL capabilities. More advanced SQL features or a procedural approach with a scripting language would be required to complete this complex time series analysis.
","This query requires a multi-step approach due to the complexity of calculating consecutive positive weeks and subsequent performance.  A pure SQL solution in ClickHouse, especially for versions prior to 22.8 (which introduced window functions with frames), is incredibly challenging for this specific scenario.  A stored procedure or a combination of SQL and client-side processing would be more suitable. I'll outline the general approach and provide a partial SQL framework.

Explanation and Limitations:

* The provided SQL handles the initial steps of calculating weekly changes.
* Identifying consecutive positive weeks requires more advanced techniques (window functions with frames or procedural logic) that weren't readily available in older ClickHouse versions.

Which NSE stocks closed above ?1000 with a 10% increase in trading volume compared to their average?,"- Intent: Identify  stocks that closed above ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¹1000 with a 10% increase in trading volume compared to their 20-day average.
- Required Tables: `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`

**Explanation of Additional Considerations:**

* **Date Handling:** The query implies the current date for the closing price and volume conditions. So, the date condition is set to '2024-11-19'. The 20-day average volume is calculated for the 20 days preceding this date.
* **Percentage Increase:** The ""10% increase"" condition requires calculating the average volume over the past 20 days and then checking if the current day's volume is at least 110% of that average.
* ** Stocks:** The condition  `master_prime_1d.index_name LIKE '%%'` filters for stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange ().
* **> 1000:**  This condition filters the result by checking closing price to be greater than 1000.

Here's a breakdown of how this information would be used to construct the SQL query (illustrative):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT company_name
FROM master_prime_1d AS mp
JOIN (
    SELECT security_code, low AS current_low, close as current_close
    FROM equity_prices_1d
    WHERE date_time = '2024-09-20'
) AS current_prices ON mp.security_code = current_prices.security_code
WHERE current_prices.current_close <= (
    SELECT MIN(low) * 1.05
    FROM equity_prices_1d AS historical_prices

      AND historical_prices.date_time BETWEEN '2023-09-20' AND '2024-09-20'  -- 52-week period
);

```
This SQL query first calculates the 52-week low for each stock, then filters for stocks where the closing price on 2024-09-20 is within 5% of that low.  Finally, it retrieves the company names of these stocks using a join with `master_prime_1d`.


The structured format helps in clearly defining the components needed for query generation and allows for a more systematic approach to converting natural language into SQL.

- Required Tables: `equity_prices_1d`
- Columns: `date_time`, `security_code`, `close`, `volume`
- Conditions:  
    - Date condition for calculating weekly volumes up to July 16, 2024. (This will involve calculating the two weeks preceding July 16, 2024 and filtering data accordingly).
    - Conditions to check for cocutive weekly volume increases. (This might require subqueries or common table expressions (CTEs) to compare weekly volumes).

Let's break down the complex logic required for the SQL query and construct a conceptual framework.

**1. Weekly Volume Calculation:**

We need to calculate weekly volumes for the two weeks leading up to July 16, 2024.  This can be achieved using a CTE (Common Table Expression) and `strftime('%Y-%m-%d', date('now', '-14 days'))` to calculate dates efficiently. Let's call this CTE `weekly_volumes`.  It should group data by `security_code` and week.

**2. Cocutive Volume Increase Check:**

We need another CTE (let's call it `cocutive_increases`) that checks if the volume in the more recent week is greater than the volume in the preceding week for each `security_code`.  This likely involves a self-JOIN on the `weekly_volumes` CTE.

**3. 10-Day and 20-Day Performance:**

This requires two separate CTEs (or subqueries):  `ten_day_performance` and `twenty_day_performance`. These will calculate the percentage change in the closing price over the respective periods relative to the closing price on July 16, 2024.

**4. Final Result:**

The final query should join `cocutive_increases`, `ten_day_performance`, and `twenty_day_performance` (using `security_code`) and then select the required performance data.


This breakdown allows for a structured approach to building the complex SQL query, managing the different stages of calculation and filtering effectively.  It is important to consider efficiency and avoid redundant calculations where possible.

Here's how the query can achieve this using window functions and a CTE (Common Table Expression):

```sql
WITH RankedPrices AS (
    SELECT
        security_code,
        date_time,
        close,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY security_code ORDER BY date_time) as price_rank
    FROM equity_prices_1d
    WHERE date_time <= '2024-09-16'
),
LaggedPrices AS (
  SELECT
        security_code,
        date_time,
        close,
        LAG(close, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY security_code ORDER BY date_time) as close_lag1,
        LAG(close, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY security_code ORDER BY date_time) as close_lag2
    FROM RankedPrices
)
SELECT DISTINCT company_name
FROM master_prime_1d m
JOIN LaggedPrices lp ON m.security_code = lp.security_code
WHERE lp.close > lp.close_lag1 AND lp.close_lag1 > lp.close_lag2
;

```


This SQL query uses the `LAG()` window function to access previous rows' closing prices within each security's partition.  It then checks the condition of increasing closing prices for three cocutive days. The `RANK()` function helps ensure the order of dates when applying the `LAG()` function.  Finally, a join with `master_prime_1d` retrieves the company names.
