Which stocks on NSE showed the highest price increase in the last trading session?,"- Intent: Identify the stocks on  that experienced the largest percentage price increase in the last trading session.
- Required Tables: `master_prime_1d`, `equity_prices_1d`
- Columns: `company_name`, `close`, `date_time`
- Conditions:  `index_name` LIKE '%%' , `date_time` = '2024-11-18' (yesterday's date assuming today is 2024-11-19)
- Joins: `master_prime_1d.security_code = equity_prices_1d.security_code`
- Aggregations:  MAX(close)
- Sorting/Grouping: Order by percentage price change (calculated as (close - open) / open * 100) in descending order, limit to the top results (implicitly, likely top 1, or top few). 


It's important to note that directly translating ""highest price increase"" requires calculating the percentage change within the SQL query itself, which will involve retrieving both `open` and `close` prices for the latest date.  A more complete example incorporating this calculation would be needed for actual query generation.

Can you identify stocks trading below ?50 with high trading volumes?,"- Intent: Identify stocks trading below ÃÃÃ¥ÃÃÃ¢Ã¥Â¢ÃÃÃ¥Ã¢ÃÃ¢Ã¥Ã¢ÃÃÃ¥Ã¢ÃÃ¢Ã¥?50 with high trading volumes.
- Required Tables: `equity_prices_1d`, `master_prime_1d`
- Columns: `close`, `volume`, `company_name`
- Conditions: `close < 50`,  `date_time` between '2024-10-20' and '2024-11-19' (last 20 days for volume calculation - this can be made more sophisticated if access to current date is available within the SQL environment).
- Joins: `equity_prices_1d.security_code = master_prime_1d.security_code`
- Aggregations:  Average volume over the last 20 days could be calculated, but explicit instructions are missing about how ""high"" volume is defined.  
- Sorting/Grouping: Potentially sort by volume in descending order to prioritize the highest volume stocks among those trading below ÃÃÃ¥ÃÃÃ¢Ã¥Â¢ÃÃÃ¥Ã¢ÃÃ¢Ã¥Ã¢ÃÃÃ¥Ã¢ÃÃ¢Ã¥?50.

**Further Considerations:**

* **""High Volume"" Definition:** The query needs clarification on how to define ""high trading volume.""  Possible options include:
    * **Comparison to Average:** Calculate the average volume over the last 20 days and consider ""high volume"" as some multiple (e.g., 1.5x or 2x) of the average.  
    * **Percentile:**  Define ""high volume"" as belonging to the top n-th percentile of trading volumes within the chosen timeframe.
    * **Absolute Threshold:**  Use a fixed volume threshold (e.g., > 1,000,000 shares traded) to filter for high-volume stocks.
* **Timeframe:** The query defaults to a daily timeframe.  Is this correct, or should volume be calculated intraday?  
* **Sorting/Presentation:**  The output format isn't specified. Should the query return the `company_name`, `close` price, and the `volume`? 


If we assume ""high volume"" means greater than the average volume over the last 20 days, a sample structured query fragment (not complete SQL) would look like this:

- Sorting/Grouping: Order by percentage change in closing price (calculated as (current_close - initial_close) / initial_close)


Here's a breakdown of why some parts are designed this way:

* **Conditions**: The date condition dynamically calculates the ""last 10 days"" relative to the current date (2024-11-19).
* **Aggregations**:  While we need to calculate returns, this isn't a standard SQL aggregation like `SUM` or `AVG`. The return calculation will be a part of the SQL query itself, usually involving subqueries or window functions to compare closing prices on different dates.
* **Sorting/Grouping**: The query explicitly asks for ""top 5"" and ""bottom 5,"" implying sorting based on the calculated return.  This sorting will also be implemented within the SQL query using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.

"When was the last time the Nifty50 index went up for 3 weeks consecutively, and what was the performance in the next 3 months?","- Intent: Determine the last date when Nifty50 had three cocutive weeks of positive growth and calculate the index's performance over the following three months.

- Required Tables: `equity_prices_1d`, `master_prime_1d`

- Columns: `date_time`, `close`, `index_name`

- Conditions: `index_name LIKE '%Nifty 50%'`

- Joins: `master_prime_1d.security_code = equity_prices_1d.security_code`

- Aggregations: None (Performance will be calculated as a percentage change)

- Sorting/Grouping:  Order by `date_time` descending to find the last occurrence.


This query requires complex sequential calculations and cannot be directly expressed in a single SQL query. It would need to be implemented using a procedural approach or a more advanced analytical function within SQL, or potentially pre-calculated and stored as a separate dataset. The basic steps would be:

1. **Identify weeks:** Group data by week and calculate the weekly closing price (e.g., the last closing price of each week).
2. **Calculate weekly changes:** Determine the percentage change between cocutive weekly closing prices.
3. **Identify cocutive positive weeks:** Find sequences of three cocutive weeks where the percentage change is positive.
4. **Find the last occurrence:** Select the most recent date from the identified sequences.
5. **Calculate 3-month performance:** Calculate the percentage change in the closing price from the identified date to the closing price three months later.

Because of the nature of the question, the usual SQL query cannot be generated with the currently available SQL capabilities. More advanced SQL features or a procedural approach with a scripting language would be required to complete this complex time series analysis.
","This query requires a multi-step approach due to the complexity of calculating consecutive positive weeks and subsequent performance.  A pure SQL solution in ClickHouse, especially for versions prior to 22.8 (which introduced window functions with frames), is incredibly challenging for this specific scenario.  A stored procedure or a combination of SQL and client-side processing would be more suitable. I'll outline the general approach and provide a partial SQL framework.

```sql
-- Step 1 & 2: Calculate weekly changes (This requires date manipulation functions which may vary slightly depending on the ClickHouse version)

WITH WeeklyData AS (
    SELECT
        toStartOfWeek(""date_time"") AS week_start,  -- Get the start of the week
        ""security_code"",
        last_value(""close"") OVER (PARTITION BY ""security_code"", toStartOfWeek(""date_time"") ORDER BY ""date_time"") AS week_close, -- Get the closing price for the last day of the week.
        ""index_name""
    FROM ""equity_prices_1d"" AS ep
    INNER JOIN ""master_prime_1d"" AS mp ON ep.""security_code"" = mp.""security_code""
    WHERE ""index_name"" LIKE '%Nifty 50%'
),
WeeklyChanges AS (
    SELECT
        week_start,
        ""security_code"",
        week_close,
        week_close - prev_week_close AS weekly_change,  -- Calculate weekly changes, handling nulls
        ""index_name""
    FROM (
        SELECT
            week_start,
            ""security_code"",
            week_close,
            lag(week_close,1,0) OVER (PARTITION BY ""security_code"" ORDER BY week_start ASC) as prev_week_close, --lag is only applicable for Clickhouse version 22.8 +
            ""index_name""

        FROM WeeklyData
    )
)

--  Steps 3 & 4 (Identifying consecutive positive weeks and the last occurrence):  This would ideally be handled with window functions (available in ClickHouse 22.8 and later) or through a procedural approach outside of pure SQL due to the need for iterative comparisons.

-- Placeholder for logic to identify 3 consecutive positive weeks and find the last date.  This is difficult to implement efficiently in older ClickHouse versions without procedural extensions or window functions.
-- A stored procedure or client-side processing would be more practical.


-- Step 5 (3-month performance): Requires the date identified in the previous step.
SELECT
    -- ... Calculations to find the closing price 3 months after the identified date ...
    -- Calculate the percentage change using the closing prices.

-- ... WHERE clause based on the date criteria determined in steps 3 and 4.  ...


```


Explanation and Limitations:

* The provided SQL handles the initial steps of calculating weekly changes.
* Identifying consecutive positive weeks requires more advanced techniques (window functions with frames or procedural logic) that weren't readily available in older ClickHouse versions.
* The final performance calculation depends on the date identified in the consecutive-weeks step.

A practical solution would involve either upgrading to a newer ClickHouse version with enhanced window function support or using a stored procedure or client-side script to handle the iterative logic for finding consecutive positive weeks.  A stored procedure would allow for more complex logic and potentially better performance than trying to force a very complex query into a single SQL statement.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the conditions and aggregations:

* **52-Week High Calculation**: This requires a subquery or window function within the SQL query to determine the maximum 'high' value for each stock over the past 52 weeks (2023-11-20 to 2024-11-19).

* **Price Range Condition**:  The `close` price should be between 90% and 95% of the calculated 52-week high.

* **10-Day Average Volume**: Another subquery or window function will calculate the average `volume` for each stock over the last 10 days (2024-11-09 to 2024-11-19).

Here's a more detailed breakdown for clarity and SQL generation:

2. **5% Threshold:**  We'll calculate the 5% threshold above the 3-month low.  The condition would be `close >= 0.95 * three_month_low`.

3. **Final Filtering:** Combine the conditions to filter for stocks meeting the criteria on 2024-09-20.
